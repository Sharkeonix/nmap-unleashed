## ✨ Feature Summary

- **Modern Nmap wrapper — all Nmap commands, but extended**  
  Use `nu` exactly like [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) while benefiting from additional usability improvements and sensible defaults combined in an appealing CLI-dashboard.

- **Multithreading**  
  Run scans in parallel and tune concurrency to fit your environment and network bandwidth.

- **Easy scan management — appealing overview & live inspection**  
  Manage queued/active/completed scans, open live results, and get a clear summary view.

- **Network usage monitor**  
  See throughput and progress in real time to balance speed and network impact including custom warning thresholds.

- **Automatic & manual abort of scans**  
  Set automatic timeouts for long-running jobs or abort scans manually to avoid runaway tasks.

- **Powerful target specification loader**  
  Import targets from files, CIDR ranges, host patterns, and combine multiple sources effortlessly.

- **Parameter sets / presets**  
  Define parameter sets / presets and load any set with a single command to start scans faster.

- **Persistent dashboard summary**  
  After nmapUnleashed finishes, a `dashboard.txt` file is generated containing a complete overview of all performed scans, results, and statuses.

- **…and more**  
  Check out the docs and help page for all features.
